Script: analyse_split_pdep.py
Description:
    This script extracts word-sense pairs from a CoNLL-U file 
    and compares sense distributions between training and test datasets.

Usage:
    python analyse_split_pdep.py

Requirements:
    - Input files must be in CoNLL-U format.
    - The script uses regular expressions and dictionary operations for analysis.

Functionality:
    1. Extracts word-sense pairs from CoNLL-U formatted files.
    2. Stores extracted senses in separate text files.
    3. Loads and structures the extracted data as {word: {senses}} dictionaries.
    4. Compares the vocabulary overlap between training and test sets.
    5. Identifies words that share or differ in sense distributions between datasets.
    6. Outputs summary statistics and examples of discrepancies.

Example:
    python analyse_split_pdep.py
