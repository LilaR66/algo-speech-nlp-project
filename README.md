# algo-speech-nlp-project

You can find here the modification I wrote for this project:

- You can refer to the document `mise-en-place-projet.docx` to see how I set up my environment and all the changes I did. 
- The script main.py has been changed so it could be run on cpu. The deprecated line about `read_csv` have also been changed. The changes are highlited with `### text ###`
- The script `one_experiment.sh` has been created. As said in the document `mise-en-place-projet.docx`, you can put it in the main repo `bert-has-uncommon-sense` to run it (see the .docx to see how)
